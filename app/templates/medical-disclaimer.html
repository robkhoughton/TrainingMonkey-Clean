        <h3>2.1 Training Analysis Limitations</h3>
        <p>Our training load analysis and AI recommendations are based on:</p>
        <ul>

            <strong>Professional Consultation Required:</strong> Before making significant changes to your training based on our recommendations, consult with qualified professionals such as certified coaches, sports medicine physicians, or physical therapists.
        </div>

        <h3>2.2 Training Recommendations</h3>
        <p>Our AI-powered training recommendations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Are based on general training principles, not your specific medical history</li>

            <li>May not be appropriate for all fitness levels or health conditions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Injury Prevention and Risk Assessment</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Injury Risk Calculations</h3>
        <p>Our injury risk assessments use established metrics like Acute Chronic Workload Ratio (ACWR) and Training Impulse (TRIMP). However:</p>
        
        <div class="critical-warning">
            <strong>Important Limitations:</strong>
            <ul>

                <li>Many injury risk factors cannot be detected from activity data alone</li>
                <li>Individual biomechanics, nutrition, sleep, and health status significantly impact injury risk</li>
                <li>No algorithm can guarantee injury prevention</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>3.2 When to Seek Professional Help</h3>
        <div class="risk-factors">
