AI Analysis from the Dashboard
• For 8/11/2025
METRIC ASSESSMENT: Critical undertraining signals present with both External ACWR (0.27) and Internal ACWR (0.41) well below optimal range (0.8-1.3). However, severe negative divergence (-0.412) indicates significant physiological stress despite low mechanical load, suggesting incomplete recovery from previous training stress. Days since rest (2) is acceptable, but divergence threshold demands conservative approach. TODAY: Active recovery only - limit to 30-45 minutes easy walking or Zone 1 activity maximum. Target TRIMP <25 to avoid further internal stress accumulation. The recent 5.4-mile session with TRIMP 58 appears to have triggered the divergence deterioration, indicating current sensitivity to moderate loads.

🤖 AI Training Decision for TODAY'S WORKOUT (Monday, August 11): SAFETY CHECK: Days since rest = 1 ✓ (within safe range) OVERTRAINING CHECK: Normalized Divergence = -0.111 (moderate risk zone, approaching -0.15 threshold) ACWR CHECK: Both External (0.17) and Internal (0.19) ACWR are severely below optimal range (0.8-1.3), indicating significant undertraining PRIMARY ASSESSMENT: Despite undertraining opportunity classification, the negative divergence (-0.111) and recent "significant load spike" warning take precedence. The 3.2-mile session on 2025-08-08 with TRIMP 26 and ACWR spike to 1.59/1.67 indicates poor load tolerance in current state. TODAY: Conservative progression session - target 4-5 miles at easy effort (Zones 1-2 only) to begin raising 7-day average from current 1.22 miles/day. Aim for TRIMP 20-30 maximum. Avoid any intensity above moderate given divergence concerns and recent spike sensitivity pattern.

🤖 AI Training Decision for WORKOUT for Sunday, August 10: METRIC ASSESSMENT: Critical undertraining signals with External ACWR (0.17) and Internal ACWR (0.19) both severely below optimal range (0.8-1.3). However, negative divergence (-0.111) approaching moderate risk threshold (-0.15) indicates residual physiological stress despite minimal mechanical load. Recent rest day provides recovery foundation. TODAY: Conservative progression session - target 4-5 miles at easy effort (Zones 1-2) to begin raising 7-day average from current 1.22 miles/day. Aim for TRIMP 35-45 maximum. Avoid intensity despite undertraining status due to divergence warning signal. RATIONALE: Must address severe undertraining while respecting physiological stress indicators. Gradual load restoration prevents triggering overtraining response during adaptation phase.
