Target sessions should maintain aerobic volume but eliminate intensity - no TRIMP values above 50 until divergence improves to -0.08 or better. Your recent pattern shows decreasing weekly volume, which is appropriate given current metrics.\n\n**ACWR MANAGEMENT:** Current 7-day averages are appropriately below your 28-day baseline, but the negative divergence suggests your body isn't adapting efficiently to even this reduced load. Maintain current volume levels (4-5 miles/day) while focusing on Zone 1-2 efforts exclusively.\n\n**STRUCTURE:** Plan 1-2 complete rest days this week, with remaining days as easy 3-5 mile sessions.
