Fantastic run with lots of vert at elevation to inspire confidence for my upcoming 100K. Achilles/ankle complex seems to be getter progressively worse with more ankle tightness today and a couple of spikes of acute pain, but not persistant.

90 ft of vertical while walking in the last 10 minutes. At mile 2, did 4 x 20 second sprints up to 7.7 2 mph with complete recovery between sprints. Most of run was in high zone 1 or low zone 2. Energy felt good.

Mostly hiking due to grade and cobbles on trail. Felt high elevation (~7500-8500 ft) less than I expected - been a couple weeks since I have been in the mountains. All felt good.
